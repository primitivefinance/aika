Discrete event simulation manager built in Rust ðŸ¦€ . Aika is designed to have a similar base syntax to [SimPy](https://gitlab.com/team-simpy/simpy), however, has the addition of a `Manager` to improve focus on large, repetitive, data intensive simulations.

This simulator utilizes `generators`, currently an expiremental feature of Rust nightly version 1.71.0.
